## GPIO Mirror Kernel Module Polling

Follow the following steps:

1.  On the master branch, create a new directory `gpio_mirror`, with a
    Makefile and README.md.

2.  Select one of the pre-lab solutions as a starting point (save as
    `gmirror.c`). Commit your code. In the Source section of README.md
    attribute the prelab author and reason about your selection.

3.  Validate the correct behavior when the module is loaded to the
    board. Commit any changes.

4.  Observe the responsiveness of this implementation. Do switch changes
    immediately propagate to the LEDs? Reason about your observation.

5.  Modify your code to get the best possible responsiveness while still
    polling. Measure and observe side effects of this implementation.
    Reason about it in post lab.

6.  Commit any pending code change.

In thius issue  discuss to reflect on any challenges and pitfalls as well as solutions.
If needed, add a known issues section to the README.


In post-lab update the README.md to include: project description,
installation/make instructions, usage definition, usage examples, and
example output (pulsecap visualization). Specifically document how a
user can identify the parameters to load the kernel module (not just the
values, but how to find them).
