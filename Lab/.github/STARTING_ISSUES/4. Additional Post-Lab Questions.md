## Additional Post-Lab Questions

This lab aims to shape the 'report' portion as a project README.md 
(on the main branch). 

Rename the current `README.md` into `LabInstructions.md`. 
Create a new README.md for your report 
(and include a link to the `LabInstructions.md` in your overview text). 

To get started, answer all questions mentioned  
in the individual issues (especially see the bottom portion of the issues). 

In addition, answer the following questions: 

1.  Add a Design Discussion section to README.md (on the main branch). 
    In #2 and #3, you have
    implemented equivalent functionality with two different methods.
    What is the difference in impact to the overall system load between
    the two modes of implementation? Compare the impact on performance
    as you as a developer, try to increase the overall responsivenness
    of interactive user inputs/outputs in an embedded system.
