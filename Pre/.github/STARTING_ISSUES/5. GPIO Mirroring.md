## GPIO Mirroring

Implement the functions that modify the GPIO states, refer to the TODO comments inside each of them:

* ```get_switch_states```
* ```set_leds```
* ```initialize_gpio```

To implement state and direction changes, instead of memory mapped accesses (register reads and writes), we will be using the kernel GPIO interfaces. Refer to and use the following kernel functions (full description can be found [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.10/driver-api/gpio/legacy.html)):

* ```gpio_get_value(unsigned int gpio)``` : get GPIO state
* ```gpio_direction_input(unsigned int gpio)``` : set a GPIO as input
* ```gpio_direction_output(unsigned int gpio, int value)``` : set a GPIO as output and set state
* ```gpio_set_value(unsigned int gpio, int value)``` : if output, set state

Finally, implement the state mirroring from the Switch states to LED states by calling ```get_switch_states``` and ```set_leds```.
