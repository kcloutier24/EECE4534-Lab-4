## 1. Linux GPIO Numbers

In Linux, the GPIO subsystem of the kernel manages GPIO ports (in contrast to direct memory mapped access that we have done previously). In the kernel terminology, GPIO controllers (such as the AXI GPIO controller present on our Zynq, for instance) are called "gpio chips". Each chip has a base number, and each of the GPIOs that are controlled by it get assigned a number (for instance, if a gpio chip base number is 227, the first GPIO controlled by it is gpio227, the second gpio228, and so on and so forth).

Using QEMU, inspect the folder /sys/class/gpio and report on what are the GPIO range for the LEDs and for the Switches (i.e., LEDs are gpio(X...Y) and Switches are gpio(Z...W). Use ```ls -l``` to see symbolic links to the devices reveal the base address of each gpio chip.   Correleate the base addresses with the hardware mapping document. The GPIO numbers will not change between power cycles of the board, you only need to obtain them once. 

Comment with your observations and a  *gpio_table* with the answer to this question.
