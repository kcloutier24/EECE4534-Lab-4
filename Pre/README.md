# Reading list

Please read through the list and use the resources as a reference for your assignments.

1. [Kernel GPIO API](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.10/driver-api/gpio/index.html)
2. [Kernel Legacy GPIO API](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.10/driver-api/gpio/legacy.html)

# Pre-lab assignment

We will use again QEMU to simulate Linux running on a Zynq CPU. Please refer to [ARMXCompSim](https://neu-ece-4534.github.io/ARMXCompSim.html) for instructions.

The instructions for ths lab are detailed in the following steps:

1. (Reserved for feedback branch pull request. You will receive top level feedback there). 
2. [Linux GPIO Numbers](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/2.%20Linux%20GPIO%20Numbers.md)
3. [Module Argument Passing](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/3.%20Module%20Argument%20Passing.md)
4. [Module Init](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/4.%20Module%20Init.md)
5. [GPIO Mirroring](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/5.%20GPIO%20Mirroring.md)

After accepting this assignment in github classroom, each step is converted into a [github issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues). Follow the issues in numerically increasing issue number (the first issue is typically on the bottom of the list). 

## General Rules

Please commit your code frequently or at e very logical break. Each commit should have a meaningful commit message and [cross reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests) the issue the commit belongs to. Ideally, there would be no commits without referencing to a github issue. 

Please comment on each issue with the problems faced and your approach to solve them. Close an issue when done.
